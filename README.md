# GAME NAME: Cat Burglar

# GAME INTENT:

To be an enjoyable survival experience against hordes of asynchronous enemies, with a simple flash-game appeal.

# NARRATIVE:

The vicious rhombuses are raining down from the sky, on a planet whose sole resident is a cat. Life has been rough for the cat, whose name is Cassandra. She is so poor, she can't even afford gravity. To escape, she needs to collect money, which manifests here as a fancier, pentagonal diamond. The treasure always disappears as soon as she gets to it, providing a bleak experience for the noided user. If a diamond touches her, she cuts herself on its sharp edges, and cries because of the pain, offscreen. The background is white because it is a snow planet, always mid-blizzard.

# MECHANICS: 

You control Cassandra via mouse input, which she follows attentively. You must dodge the raining rhombi, which come down around once a second. The diamond spawns in a random location each time you collide with it. There is no point tally: As mentioned in the narrative, this is  a postmodern game.

# AESTHETICS:

We made good use of the theme words, our protagonist being a cat. This makes the gamer trust the protag, it being a cat and all. The background is vague, but nice, feeling static, white, and voidy. The multicolored, organized rhombi are pleasing to the eyes, and the goal, protag, and enemies are all intuitive. We intelligently used both diamonds in the math sense, and diamonds in the gem sense, really packing in diamonds on diamonds into this game.

# JOYS:

First getting GitKraken to work, and joyfully passing the file back and forth every few minutes like two middle schoolers who between them just got their first flip phone. Picking out fun art, cultivating a genuine aesthetic. The joy that always comes with a coding project being brought to fruition, that true creative rush, embedded in a logic game.

# STRUGGLES:

Haggling with C# as a newbie. Waiting on huge files to load and get passed back and forth. The standard difficult coding problems, where you've got to turn your brain off and slowly unravel everything you've done until you've found it.
